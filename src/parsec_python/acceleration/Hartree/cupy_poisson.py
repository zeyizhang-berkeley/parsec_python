"""Optional float64 CuPy solver for the isolated Hartree Poisson problem.

The physical boundary construction deliberately remains on the host and
reuses the validated reference helpers.  Only the repeated conjugate-gradient
linear algebra runs on CUDA.  A :class:`CuPyPoissonSolver` is constructed from
the same :class:`~parsec_python.acceleration.backends.cupy.CuPyHamiltonian` used
by the GPU Kohn--Sham eigensolver, so its already-uploaded negative-Laplacian
CSR allocation is reused rather than copied to the device a second time.

CuPy is an optional dependency.  Importing this module never imports CuPy;
the runtime is requested only when a solver object is constructed.

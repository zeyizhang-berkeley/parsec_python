    B = qinv(A [, tol])
    Quasi-inverse of A by QR factorization with column pivoting.
    tol is the tolerance, a small positive scalar.

    The QR factorization of A with column pivoting is denoted by A*P=Q*R,
    where A is the given m-by-n matrix (m>=n), P is permutation matrix,
    Q is an m-by-n matrix of orthogonal columns, R is rank-revealing upper
    triangular matrix in the form [ R11 R12 ; 0 0 ], with R11 nonsingular.

    In some sense S = [ R11^{-1} 0 ; 0 0 ] plays the role of the inverse
    of R. We call B = P*S*Q^T the quasi-inverse of B. If A is square and
    has full-rank, then B is the inverse of A. Note that x=B*b is a
    solution to the least square problem of minimizing ||Ax-b||_2.
